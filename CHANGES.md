# Changes from upstream

This is a fork of [satheeshds/gbp-review-agent](https://github.com/satheeshds/gbp-review-agent) extending the scope from "reviews only" to the full Google Business Profile surface.

## v0.2.0 (forked)

### Security repairs (2026-10-21)

- Bind OAuth callbacks to a short-lived one-use attempt with S256 PKCE; bind
  the enrollment HTTP listener to loopback and suppress provider exception bodies.
- Use one private atomic token writer for enrollment, refresh and clearing;
  compile shared helpers into the existing `build/` package layout.
- Retain offline security regressions in the normal `npm test` path.

### New service stubs (mock-mode runnable today, real GBP API wired when API access is approved)

- `postService` — local posts: list, create, update, delete (STANDARD/EVENT/OFFER/ALERT)
- `qaService` — questions + answers (list, owner-upsert, delete) on the dedicated `mybusinessqanda` host
- `mediaService` — photos and videos (list, create from URL, start streamed upload, delete)
- `insightsService` — Business Profile Performance API: daily/multi-daily metrics, monthly search keywords
- `businessInfoService` — locations, attributes, categories, services, verifications across `mybusinessbusinessinformation` and `mybusinessverifications`

### apiClient extensions

- `delete()` and `patch()` HTTP methods (needed for posts update, media delete, attribute updates, etc.)
- `baseUrl` arg on every method — GBP is fragmented across multiple hosts (legacy v4, BUSINESS_INFO, QANDA, PERFORMANCE, VERIFICATIONS, ACCOUNT_MGMT). Routes pick the right host per call.
- `GOOGLE_API.HOSTS` constant enumerates the 7 sub-API hosts.

### Why the fork

Upstream covers reviews well. For a private medical practice doing local SEO, reviews are a medium-impact lever; posts and Q&A are higher-impact and need to be in the same MCP. Splitting concerns across multiple servers would balloon the auth surface and confuse the agent's tool selection.

### Roadmap

- [x] Wire posts service tools into mcpServer.ts (4 tools)
- [x] Wire Q&A tools (4 tools — beyond InsightfulPipe coverage)
- [x] Wire media tools (4 tools, URL-source + streamed upload)
- [x] Wire insights tools (3 tools — Business Profile Performance API)
- [x] Wire business info / attributes tools (7 tools)
- [x] Wire delete_review_reply (InsightfulPipe parity)
- [x] Mock-mode end-to-end smoke test (boot + 3 sample tool calls verified)
- [ ] OAuth scope check for additional sub-APIs (current `business.manage` covers most; verify Performance API)
- [ ] End-to-end test against live GBP once API approval lands
- [ ] Optional: open-source the fork once stable — there's a real ecosystem gap here

**Status:** 28 MCP tools registered, type-checks clean, mock mode verified.
